# Circuiters 
Circuiters Webpage is used to place an order to repair a product, and it'll change the status of the order based on the admin's selection.
The webpage was developed with Python in the Django framework as a backend and MySQL as a database.
The front-end was coded with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and basic JavaScript.
The circuiters webpage has signup and login functionality and also has an admin page that can be accessed only by an admin with valid credentials. 
The admin page will display all the messages and orders initiated by customers in a categorized manner and have an option to accept or reject the order.
The circuiters webpage was deployed on PythonAnywhere web hosting service http://circuiters.pythonanywhere.com/signup
